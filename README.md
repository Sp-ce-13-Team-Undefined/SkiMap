# SkiMap
> Webapp per la ricerca di piste e scuole da sci in Lombardia.  

## [ENG] Info  
This webapp has been made with âœ¨ [nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/).  
It uses SSR, fetches data from the `Open data lombardia` data center and visualizes them on a Google map. I've limited the Google Maps API to 50 requests per day so that I don't get a bill for this project, so if the map doesn't load you know why.  
This has been built in just a couple of weeks for a school project!
